SELF.$mychoice

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24215578/when-should-i-access-properties-with-self-in-swift

The only times self is required are when referencing a property inside a closure and, as you pointed out, to differentiate it from local variable with the same name.

However, personally, I prefer to always write "self" because:

That is an instant and obvious sign that the variable is a property. This is important because it being a property means that its state can vary more widely and in different ways than a local variable. Also, changing a property has larger implications than changing a local variable.

The code does not need to be updated if you decide to introduce a parameter or variable with the same name as the property

Code can be easily copied in and out of closures that do require self






    @Binding var mychoice: String
    var body: some View {
                
                Text("\($mychoice)")
                Text(mychoice)
                Text($mychoice) - oshibka
                Text(self.mychoice)
